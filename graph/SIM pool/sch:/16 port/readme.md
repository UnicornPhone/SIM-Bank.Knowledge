16 Ports 16 SIM Card Slots Wireless USB Interface GSM Bulk SMS Modem Pool
A 16-port SIM pool is a telecommunications device, often used for bulk messaging, that can hold up to 16 SIM cards. It allows for the simultaneous use of multiple SIMs to send messages, potentially bypassing restrictions imposed by carriers on individual SIM usage. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Functionality:
A 16-port SIM pool essentially acts as a modem bank, connecting to a network and enabling the use of multiple SIM cards for sending or receiving messages. 
Bulk Messaging:
These devices are commonly used for bulk SMS sending, where a large number of messages need to be sent to many recipients. 
SIM Rotation:
Some SIM pools support SIM rotation, which allows the device to automatically cycle through different SIM cards to send messages, helping to avoid potential carrier restrictions. 
Applications:
16-port SIM pools are used in various applications, including sending promotional SMS, notifications, appointment reminders, and two-factor authentication codes. 
Types:
They come in various forms, including USB-based modems, 2G/3G/4G models, and even VoIP gateways that support SIM pools for voice messaging. 
Cost-Effectiveness:
While the initial cost of a 16-port SIM pool may be higher, it can be more cost-effective than using individual SIMs, especially when considering the volume of messages sent, according to China Skyline.
